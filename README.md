# Flappy Dragon Clone

This is another quick project in my learning rust adventure.

Program will not run with the nightly build 

```rustup default stable```


## Flapping Your Wings

Run the game now with cargo run. Press P to play the game, and youâ€™ll see a yellow @ representing the player. It falls toward the bottom and flaps upward when you press SPACEBAR. When it falls off the bottom of the window, the game mode transitions to the game over menu.
